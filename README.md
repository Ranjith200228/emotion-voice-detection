# 🎤 Detection of Emotion Using Human Voice

A deep learning-based project that classifies human emotions from voice recordings using audio feature extraction and neural networks. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Librosa, this project demonstrates the power of speech emotion recognition for intelligent applications.

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on identifying **emotional states** from voice inputs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** combined with **LSTM layers**. It uses audio features like **MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** for training a deep learning model capable of detecting emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, and more.

It includes an **interactive GUI** developed with **Tkinter** for real-time testing of the model.
